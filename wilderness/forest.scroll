    * Giant red, purple and blue mushrooms grow beside the trees here, their
      colors are vibrant and bright, much like gem stones.

    * The trees here are naked and twisted. Their branches reach down like bony
      claws. Was this place cursed in days long gone?

    * So big and tall are the trees here. Their tops are almost hidden by the
      dense mist.  Their trunks are as wide as a hut. Some of them have planks
      of wood attached, forming a ladder.

    * A huge, lush tree is standing in a clearing here, covered with colorful
      flowers and holding a sweet berry inside. Birds fly cheerfully around it.

    * Moss covered ruins of an ancient stone structure emerge from within the
      vegetation. Carvings of spirals and swirls decorate some of the larger
      stones.

    * The forest is dense and dark here, but countless clusters of
      phosphorescent fungi are growing near the base of the trunks, creating a
      luminous colorful glow above the ground.

    * Dense ivy and vegetation cover an old skeleton of a {{Skeleton}}
      in a clearing surrounded by the trees.

    * Ropes tangle down from the branches here. On some of them, human-sized
      straw-made figures are hanging by their canvas covered heads.

    * Dozens of giant dead tree trunks are laying on the ground here, covered
      with moss and undergrowth. Some of them seem to have a face, with a
      frozen expression of agony.

    * An oversized statue of {{articlize(Statue)}} holding a sword
      against the ground stands proudly in a clearing here.
      Fresh flowers were recently placed near its base.

    * There's a stream of clear water here, flowing gently between the woods,
      over the smooth rock ground.

    * Colorful flowers, berry shrubs and mushrooms grow under the woods
      here, dense enough to almost entirely cover a large number of human-like bones.

    * A small pond sits between the woods here. At night, countless
      mysterious forms glow an eerie purple light deep in the water.
