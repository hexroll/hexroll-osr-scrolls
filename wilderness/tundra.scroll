  Supplemental! @ [
    * The ice here is blindingly bright in daylight. It is almost too much
      to bear for those who are accustomed to the darkness of the depths.

    * The ice plateaus here are mostly opaque, but every now and then it
      reveals ominous shadows of creatures swimming or perhaps lurking underneath.

    * In the middle of the icy wasteland, a large round snowy rock emerges from
      the snow. Easy enough to climb on and perhaps find some shelter from
      the cold.

    * The ice here is thick but broken and cracked. It is a challenge to find
      a safe path to follow, and quite often, a leap is required to move about.

    * The snow here is soft to walk on. Too soft. In some places, taking the
      next step means falling down deep into a sinkhole.

    * Gusts of wind swirls the soft snow in the air, making it difficult to
      walk safely and comfortably as it obscures the vision and hits any
      exposed skin with a freezing sting.

    * Vast plateaus of ice strech in all directions, feature-less and
      monotonous. Navigating is difficult without any distant landmarks.

    * Tall pillars of ice emerge from the snow here, as if water has risen
      from the ground, only to be captured by the frost.

    * The snow here is riddled with giant craters. Something with
      much force and velocity must have fallen from the sky.

    * The ruins of a giant wall of ice can be seen in the distance.
      The formation is unatural, unmaintained, and impressive.

    * There are caverns of translucent ice here. Frozen creatures
      and ancient artifacts could be spotted if walking inside them.

    * There are several deep frozen chasms here, with unnatural thin
      bridges providing the only way to cross.

    * There's a glacier here, almost impossible to climb through, with
      fraglie excavated tunnels dug in it to provide an unsafe passage.

    * There's a large ice wall here, forming a natural dam, blocking
      a large body of icy water from flooding the area.

    * A frozen waterfall is the only way to march {{Direction}} from here
      and will require climbing or rappelling to cross it.

    * Several dome shaped shalters are scattered on the snowy planes
      here, providing a convenient hideout from the cold.
